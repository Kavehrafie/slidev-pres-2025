Ziapour's Fighting Rooster (Khorus Jangi):
- This iconic design was the cover for the Khorus Jangi magazine, launched in 1948 by the avant-garde association of the same name (Ziapour, Shirvani, Gharib, Sheybani, Hannaneh, etc.).
- Symbolism: Represents wakefulness, a new dawn, resistance against stagnation, artistic independence, and adapting Iranian culture to modernity/machine age. It was their visual manifesto.

Jalil Ziapour & the Rooster:
- Left: Ziapour himself in 1952, a leading figure in the Khorus Jangi group and a key proponent of Cubism in Iran. Note the 'giveh' footwear, perhaps hinting at the blend of modernism and local context.
- Right: The Khorus Jangi rooster emblem, symbolizing the group's avant-garde spirit and goals (wakefulness, resistance, modernity).

<!--
Khorus Jangi Magazine & Nima Yushij:
- This is the first issue of the Khorus Jangi magazine (1948), a key platform for the avant-garde group.
- Inside cover features the poem "From the City of Morning" by the highly influential modernist poet Nima Yushij.
- Nima wrote the poem specifically in response to the group's choice of the "Fighting Rooster" name, linking the symbol to their mission.

<!--
Hushang Pezeshkniya - Early Modernism:
- Artist: Hushang Pezeshkniya, another important modernist painter active in this period. He studied in Turkey before returning to Iran.
- Work: "Crucified" (1946). This early date shows engagement with modern European forms (Expressionism/Cubism influences) even before the formal establishment of Khorus Jangi.
- Themes: Pezeshkniya often depicted the lives of ordinary people.
Pezeshkniya - Social Themes:
- Work: "Untitled (From the Oil Industry Workers)" (1958).
- Context: Shows Pezeshkniya depicting the lives of common people and laborers, specifically oil workers in Abadan.
- Style: Uses modernist fragmentation (Cubist/Expressionist influence) to portray these social themes. This aligns with the broader socially-aware current within early Iranian modernism.

Hossein Kazemi - Lyrical Modernism:
- Artist: Hossein Kazemi.
- Style: Known for blending Cubist geometry and fragmentation with the delicate lines and lyrical qualities of traditional Iranian miniature painting.
- Work: "Woman with a Pitcher" (1957).

Manuchehr Sheybani - Modernist & Intellectual:
- Artist: Manuchehr Sheybani, who was also a poet and playwright with links to the Tudeh (Communist) party.
- Style: Explored Cubism, often drawing inspiration from workers and common people, similar to Pezeshkniya. Developed his own distinct interpretations, sometimes using idiosyncratic diagonals.
- Work: "Untitled" (1958).

customCaption: Bahman Moḥaṣṣeṣ, May 1, 1953. A leaflet for International Workers' Day by The Third Force party (<i>Nīrūyi sivvum</i>)

The caption reads:{class="text-sm"}


> "The working class will triumph — the painting is a work by Bahman Moḥaṣṣeṣ in Cubist style."{class="max-w-xs"}

<!--
Bahman Mohasses - Cubism & Politics Pre-Coup:
- Artist: Bahman Mohasses, sometimes associated with the Khorus Jangi circle.
- Context: This is a leaflet for International Workers' Day (May 1, 1953) by the Third Force (Niruyi Sivvum) political party.
- Significance: The caption explicitly labels Mohasses's work as "Cubist style" and links it directly to the triumph of the working class. This demonstrates the clear association of Cubism with progressive politics in the period immediately preceding the August 1953 coup.
- The **Third Force (Niruyi Sivvum)** emerged from a significant split within the **Tudeh Party** of Iran in the late 1940s (around 1947-1948).

Shift After 1953: Rooster vs. Heech:
- This comparison symbolizes the profound shift in Iranian art and culture after the 1953 coup.
- Left (Post-Coup): Parviz Tanavoli's "Heech" (Nothing), emerging in the 1960s/70s, associated with the Saqqakhaneh movement. Represents a turn towards ambiguity, local vernacular, perhaps introspection or nihilism in the changed political climate under Pahlavi patronage.
- Right (Pre-Coup): Ziapour's "Fighting Rooster" (1949), symbolizing the assertive, socially-engaged, universalist aspirations of the earlier avant-garde.
- Point: The coup marked a decline of the Khorus Jangi-era modernism and the rise of different artistic concerns.

Legacy - Militant Re-Politicization: Bizhan Jazani:
- Artist: Bizhan Jazani, a prominent Marxist theorist and founder of a major guerrilla organization opposing the Shah.
- Context: Painted "Siahkal" (c. 1970) while imprisoned (1968 until execution in 1975). The painting commemorates the 1971 Siahkal incident, considered the start of the armed struggle against the Pahlavi regime.
- Style: Uses Cubist/Expressionist fragmentation to depict this politically charged event, demonstrating the style's continued use as a language of resistance.

<!--
Enduring Resonance: Jazani & Ziapour:
- Comparison: Jazani's "Siahkal" (left, c. 1970) and Ziapour's "Khorus Jangi" rooster (right, 1949).
- Connection: Despite the different subject (deer vs. rooster), Jazani's prison painting shows strong visual and iconographic resonance with Ziapour's earlier work from two decades prior.
- Shared Elements: Use of fragmented forms, symbolism of struggle against darkness/oppression. Potentially echoes Picasso's Guernica as well.
- Point: Highlights the enduring power and adaptability of Cubist aesthetics as a visual language for political dissent and resistance across different moments in modern Iranian history.

## "From the City of the Morning" by Nīmā Yūshīj

_Cock-a-doodle-doo, crows the rooster,_
_from the bottom of his solipsistic heart,_
_from the depths of the way, like a dry vein,_
_his voice pumps blood into lifeless corpse,_
...

_his voice delivers the message (of hope) to the free ear,_
_shows the caravan its way to ābādān,_
_through this kharāb-ābād._

_He strolls gently,_
_He chants warmly,_
_Beating his wings,_
_Spreading his feathers._

_Longing for his voice, the caravan listens intently,_
_is in high spirit because of its elegant voice,_
_Cock-a-doodle-doo. On this dark path,_
_Who is it who has fallen behind?_
_Who is it, who is tired?_
...


<!--
NOTE:
Nima Yushij's "From the City of the Morning" (Excerpt):
- Key Imagery: The rooster's crow guides a caravan out of darkness ("kharāb-ābād" - ruined place) towards light/progress ("ābādān" - prosperous place), awakening "oppressed souls."
- Connection: Directly mirrors the Khorus Jangi group's ambition to awaken public consciousness and lead Iranian culture towards modernity.
