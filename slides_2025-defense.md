# Pleated Modernity

## On the Anthropologization of Modern Art in Iran, 1941--1979

Advisor: Blake Stimson

Committee: Elise Archias, Norma Claire Moruzzi, Nicholas Brown, and Peyman Vahabzadeh

<!--
# Intro:

I want to briefly go over my dissertation titled "P...."
This dissertation examines the evolution of modern art in Iran from 1941 to 1979, a period defined by the nation’s fraught transition into a globalized capitalist society. The major of this period falls under what the Cold War and the attempts of decolonized nations to developed and the era of the formationaton of neocolonialism.

For my study, I will focus on the ethnographic practices of three Iranian artists: Ziapour, Tanavoli, and Monir. These artists were instrumental in shaping the modern art scene in Iran during the period under discussion. Through their practice they struggle to reconcile the contradictions of a modernizing nation. From Ziapour's attempt to estanlish the autonomy of art and institutions to the later anthropologial thrust in refashioning the identity
Tumultuous transition from agrarian to globally integrated capitalist society.

## Introduction: The Rooster Crows
This chapter examines historical conditions that enabled modernist art in Iran, and through this examination, it actively challenges reductive framing of cultural development based on national identity. Instead, it argues for modernism as not merely belated or derivative, but as an active negotiation of art production within a global capitalist modernity—a process inextricably linked to Iran’s uneven integration into it, and its simultaneous aspirations for a socialist modernity.

## Jalil Ziapour: Constructing the Public
### Through Ziapour’s development, this chapter examines how modernism in Iran negotiated dual imperatives—the early push for artistic autonomy, followed by the post-1953 coup shift toward ethnography, aligned with Surrealist paradigms.

##  Parviz Tanavoli as Poet-Prophet
In this chapter, I trace Tanavoli's artistic development through his discovery of the collective unconscious in southern Tehran's junkyards and artisanal workshops. Positioning himself as a modern Farhad, Tanavoli's mythmaking claimed to revive 'Persian sculpture' by retrieving its ancient spirit from craft – a tradition he argued survived despite the Islamic ban on image-making. This project, connecting a suppressed past to a renewed present, garnered the crucial support of Empress Farah and American collector Abby Weed Grey.

## Monir Farmanfarmaian as Occult Technician
This chapter positions Farmanfarmaian’s mirror-work as a technology of enchantment, directly responding to the anxieties of modernization and the vanishing of pre-modern Iranian culture. Her transatlantic practice, integrating New York’s post-minimalism with nomadic art and Iranian craft traditions, transformed these elements into a strategic aesthetic paradigm that materialized a transnational condition where artisanal 'charm' conveyed cultural fluidity while enmeshed in neocolonial circuits of value.

## Coda

The conclusion examines how abstraction evolved from an internal organizing principle—as initially explored in Cubism—to its objectification as sculptural forms and patterns. This progression is evident from late Ziapour's tiles, to Tanavoli's grilles, and Farmanfarmaian's tessellations. This reification signals a move towards a structuralist view of culture. Here, an overemphasis on objectified, singular structure became the hallmark of an anthropological tendency, erasing subjectivity.
