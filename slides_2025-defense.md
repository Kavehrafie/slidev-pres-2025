# Intro:

I want to briefly go over my dissertation titled "P...."
This dissertation examines the evolution of modern art in Iran from 1941 to 1979, a period defined by the nation’s fraught transition into a globalized capitalist society. The major of this period falls under what the Cold War and the attempts of decolonized nations to developed and the era of the formationaton of neocolonialism.

For my study, I will focus on the ethnographic practices of three Iranian artists: Ziapour, Tanavoli, and Monir. These artists were instrumental in shaping the modern art scene in Iran during the period under discussion. Through their practice they struggle to reconcile the contradictions of a modernizing nation. From Ziapour's attempt to estanlish the autonomy of art and institutions to the later anthropologial thrust in refashioning the identity
Tumultuous transition from agrarian to globally integrated capitalist society.
