## "From the City of Morning" by Nīmā Yūshīj

_Cock-a-doodle-doo, crows the rooster,_  
_from the bottom of his solipsistic heart,_  
_from the depths of the way, like a dry vein,_  
_his voice pumps blood into lifeless corpse,_  
...

_his voice delivers the message (of hope) to the free ear,_  
_shows the caravan its way to ābādān,_  
_through this kharāb-ābād._

_He strolls gently,_  
_He chants warmly,_  
_Beating his wings,_  
_Spreading his feathers._

_Longing for his voice, the caravan listens intently,_  
_is in high spirit because of its elegant voice,_  
_Cock-a-doodle-doo. On this dark path,_  
_Who is it who has fallen behind?_
_Who is it, who is tired?_  
...
