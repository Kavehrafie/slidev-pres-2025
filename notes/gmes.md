title: Cubism in Iran, 1940--1960
subtitle: A Horizon of a Socialist Modernity

### argument 
My argument is simple. The emergence of Cubism, among the emergence of other European style of painting such as Impressionism, post-impressionism, expressionism, in Iran in the second half of the twentieth century can be attributed to the avant-garde aspiration in construting, forming the social by the modenrist Iranian artists developed against the backdrop their struggle for artistic autonomy and the larger national struggle for the politico-economic soverinty interrupted by the MI6/CIA‌ orchastereated coup in 1953. It began as a universalist aspiration to elevate the culture, form a new public with a vanguardian edge. This Cubims however has iranian characterstics and more commonalities with futurism and constructivism due to its dynamic diagonals.

When in its ealiest stage it was vehemently opposed due to the political and cultural resistance, it soon gave a vocaulary to reimage a new Iran for the artist. In the post-coup era, however, Cubism declined and ultimately gave its way to other movements and tendencies inclusding the much discussed Saqqakhaneh school in the 1960s. Unlike this pre-coup Cubism, Saqqakhaneh explored abstraction in a particularizing and local appropriating vernacular culture and objects. 

### the begining 
In 1948, a group of avant-garde artists and writers---Jalil Ziapour, Hasan Shirvāni (?), Gholāmhossein Gharib (1922–2005), Manuchehr Sheybāni (1924–1991), and Mortezā Hannāneh, sometimes they have other artists joiing them Nima Yushij, Sadegh Hedayat, Sohrab Sepehri, and Bahman Mohasses---decided to form an association called Khorus Jangi. They publish their first magazine in the same year under the same title. 

The cover of the magazine came with a lone rooster standing tall, wings opened, chest pomped and foots solidly planted. The quietessential aspects of the work are intersecting diognals cutting through the figure like a cheese. 
Ziapour's rooster was one of the early example of the spirit of the new generation of artists mostly returned to Iran from Europe with confidence and self assurance to move the culture forward.  The rooster is a symbol of resistance and struggle for artistic indepence and national sovereinity for the economy. The rooster in its stright crisp lines also came to suggest machine. A realization of that the art of Iran and its culture need to adapt with this new alienating age.

For Ziapour and his peers, the rooster was a symbol of wakefulness and new dawn. Ziapour told Iranian modernist poet Nima Yushij about their choice of Rooster as for the name of the association. Nima sent them in response one of his poems, “From the City of Morning.” The symbolizing abunds in Nima's poem. Nima here depicts a caravan heading from t night moving foward on the Cokoolidoo of the rooster toward the light. As the caraven move forward the people joins and so forth. Here there is a heroic rooster to awaken the sould of people opressed like artists and writers (role of organic intellectuals to be the consciese of the society). 

In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, Ziapour explored Cubism in representation of public spaces like public bathhouses, bazaar, mosques among other things. The subject matter of Ziapour's Cubism also noticed by  Iran art historian Ruin Pakbaz, who argued that "Ziapour’s “cubism” was not representative of what the term commonly denotes, for his art lacked some essential elements of Cubism. This was basically because Iranian mosques and bazaars, for example, just could not give way to industrial shapes and edifices, nor could traditional Iranian geometrical shapes, mostly curvilinear anyway, simply could not be replaced by the mechanistic geometrical forms favoured by Cubism"

Public Bath is one of interesting one. The painting was vandalized during its first display at Apadana gallery in Feb 1950 (slashed). The group who vandalized it were majority the follower of the renowned academic painter Kamal al molk. Major instituitional resistance was put by the Kamal ol-molk followers.

Established in 1911, the school was headed by Kamal ol-Molk and trained Iranian artists in turn of the century European painting styles.

In April 1949, Manuchehr Eghbāl, the Minister of Culture under Prime Minister Abdolhossein Hazhir, denounced Khorus Jangi in a speech at the National Consultative Assembly (majles-e shora-ye melli). He called it a conspiracy hatched by the communists to "corrupte the youth."
Eghbāl portrayed the magazine as part of a clandestine plot against the state, linking it to communist infiltration. This denunciation led to the forced closure of Khorus Jangi and the interrogation of Ziapour, who was an employee of the Ministry of Culture (vezārat-e farhang), which later merged under the Ministry of Education (āmuzesh va parvaresh), at the time. “Has anyone assigned you to promote Cubism? For what reasons have you chosen this field? What is essentially Cubism about?” Ziapour recalls being introgatted about his motivations for promoting Cubism.1

In his seminal 1948 essay “Painting” (Naqqāshi), published in five consequent parts in the first series of Khorus Jangi, Ziapour defended his position, stating that “a Cubist artist is neither a decadent nor degenerate but rather a militant and progressive artist.”1 This characterization of the Cubist artist as an “independent” and strident fighter aspiring to elevate culture reflected Ziapour’s conviction in the transformative power of art in society.2 Crucially, Ziapour argued that Cubist painting should express “radical thinking” (tafakkor-e enghelabi) that is “decisive and sharp, but at the same time rational, sober and forceful.”3 In a striking passage, Ziapour contextualized Cubism within the broader sweep of historical and social change:
… the era of Cubism was a time of struggle and consolidation of new ideas whose foundations were gradually laid long ago, and knowing this fact that along with every economic, political, and educational development, there always exists a new ideology, then one can better understand that the contexts of social change and class struggles at the time of the emergence of Cubism […] required a new ideology.4
Nevertheless, Ziapour insists that the judgment of art should rely on aesthetic merits rather than external political considerations:
From my point of view, the leading artist is someone who is a pioneer and a fighter only within their own art, not in the work of preaching and propaganda, “which is reserved for other non-artists.”5

Hossein Kazemi, Hushang Pezeshkniya, and Manouchehr Sheybani were among the artists who were inspired by Cubism and experimented with it in their works during the late 1940 and the early 1950s.

Most of these explorations were idiosybncratic implementation mostly using diagonals to fragment the picture plain. In 1946, he returned to Iran from Turkey where he studied painting under Leopold Levi, a jewish painter fleed Nazi, and participated in exhibitions at Apadana gallery. In 1948, he was employed by the Iranian British Oil company moving to Abaan, the industrial hub of Iranian oil economy, where he painted the life of common people, peasants, workers of the industry, in a more ethnographic sene.

Hossein Kazemi, another artist graduated from the faculty of Fine Arts at Tehran University (like Ziapour) who participated in Apadana, who explored Cubims in a manneristic way by combining Iranian miniature painting, especially the Safavid painting single paintings, with geometric lines of cubism in a more poetic way. He never seriously engaged with Cubismn. 

Sheybai was a poet, painter, and playwrighter (he was affiliation with Iranian communist party Tudeh) in the 1950s in particular Sheybani explored Cubism. He was inspired by the toiler and common people.


These exploration eclipsed by the 1953 and by the 1958 when the First Tehran Biennial was inaugurated. A new tendency shows came to dominance in the Iranian art scene. Now the bold idea of constructing the public gave its way to a coy pretension. 

An interesting comparison can be done with Ziapour's rooster as the personification of the modernist artist and Parviz Tanavoli's Heech (means nothing), which also various configurations of heech in farsi with its "he do cheshm (two eyed he)" letter as the head of this serpentine saging belly beast. 

Although the mainstream comepletely abandoned the early modernist aspirations of autonomy and cultural elevations, on the prephery of the 1960s and 1970s Iranian art cubism appeared as a nostalgic revisit of the earlier Khorus Jangi movement by Pezeshknian who by this time was basiclly was forgotten or a lefitst militancy as exemplified by the renokned leftist activist andne of the founders of the Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas.

One of the most stricking about Jazani's painting is it visual and iconographic resonance with Ziapour's rooster executed two decades earlier. In Jazani the same sybolism of darkness, stupidity, bull, vulture and the bats around a disc overing the moon. Jazani's work is rememberence of the Siahkal incident where a small group of fadai gorilla's storm agendermary. The androgenous anthromorphic deer at center of the painting with a dager in one hand and an eye had leaping forward. The painting might resemble Picasso's Guernica (bull was Picasso's recurring motif ignorance, violance), the lyrical paintings of marc shagal 
the fragmented and geometric body of the deer.
