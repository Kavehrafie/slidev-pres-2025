title: Cubism in Iran, 1940--1960
subtitle: A Horizon of a Socialist Modernity

### Introduction

Today, I want to talk about a fascinating, yet often overlooked, chapter in Iranian art history: the emergence and evolution of modernism in Iran, particularly an adoption of Cubism, between the 1940s and 1950s.

I argue that the adoption of Cubism and other modernist movements (including Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Expressionism) in Iran during this period should not be dismissed merely as an imitation of European trends. Rather, it represents a historically specific development within the global history of modernism. Notably, a frequent use of **dynamic diagonals** distinguished their work, suggesting links to Futurism and Constructivism and setting it apart from the predominantly analytical forms of European Cubism. While deeply engaged with local themes, this artistic surge was fueled by the avant-garde aspirations of Iranian artists seeking to overcome perceived cultural stagnation and actively shape the nation's cultural future, thereby contributing a distinct chapter to modern art's universal history. Furthermore, this social engagement was dialectically linked to the artists' pursuit of artistic autonomy amidst a larger national struggle for political and economic sovereignty—a struggle tragically cut short by the 1953 CIA/MI6-orchestrated coup.

### The Khorus Jangi Association

This early modernist impulse found concrete expression through self-organized groups of young artists. A pivotal moment occurred in 1948 with the formation of the **Khorus Jangi (Fighting Rooster)** association. This avant-garde collective included artists and writers like Jalil Ziapour, Hasan Shirvani, Gholamhossein Gharib, Manuchehr Sheybani, and Morteza Hannaneh, occasionally joined by influential figures such as Nima Yushij, Sohrab Sepehri, and Bahman Mohasses. Their magazine, also named _Khorus Jangi_, served as a key platform, featuring Ziapour's iconic rooster design on its cover—effectively their first visual manifesto. Ziapour himself became a leading advocate for Cubism, promoting it through theoretical writings and public discourse.

Ziapour's stylized rooster, defined by intersecting diagonal lines, was rich with symbolism. For the Khorus Jangi members, it represented **wakefulness, renewal, resistance, and artistic independence**, embodying the call for Iranian culture to engage with modernity and the machine age. This symbolism resonated with contemporaries like the modernist poet Nima Yushij. His poem “From the City of Morning” (Az Shahr-e Ṣobḥ), written in response to the group's name, depicted the rooster's crow as a guiding force leading society out of darkness, mirroring the association's ambition to awaken public consciousness.
### Artistic and Political Opposition

While inspired by modernity and the machine age, Ziapour adapted Cubism to depict local subjects: everyday Iranian life and vernacular architecture like public bathhouses, bazaars, and mosques. This localization led to stylistic divergences. As art historian Ruin Pakbaz noted at the time, "Ziapour’s Cubism was not representative of what the term commonly denotes, for his art lacked some essential elements of Cubism. This was largely because Iranian mosques and bazaars, for example, did not lend themselves to industrial shapes. Additionally, traditional Iranian geometrical shapes, mostly curvilinear, could not easily be replaced by the mechanistic forms favored by Cubism."(Pakbaz)

This new movement faced immediate and fierce opposition. His painting "Public Bath" was famously vandalized during its first exhibition in 1950 by followers of the established academic painter Kamal ol-Molk. By the 1940s, the followers of the academic painter Kamal ol-Molk were well established in the artistic institutions of Iran. Kamal ol-Molk himself had been trained in earlier European styles. In 1911, he established the School of Fine Arts (Ṣanāyiʿ-i Mustaẓrifa), one of the first of its kind. Significant institutional resistance came from the established artists, trained in earlier European styles at the School of Fine Arts.

This burgeoning modernist movement immediately encountered **fierce opposition**. Resistance came from the established art world, particularly followers of the academic painter Kamal ol-Molk, whose traditional European style dominated institutions like the School of Fine Arts (Ṣanāyiʿ-i Mustaẓrifa), founded in 1911. This artistic conservatism manifested directly when Ziapour's painting "Public Bath" was vandalized during its 1950 exhibition.

The opposition quickly escalated to the **political sphere**. In April 1949, Minister of Culture Manuchehr Eghbāl publicly denounced Khorus Jangi in parliament, labeling it a communist plot aimed at "corrupting the youth." This accusation resulted in the _Khorus Jangi_ magazine being shut down and Ziapour facing interrogation by his employer, the Ministry of Culture, demanding justification for his promotion of Cubism.

In response, Ziapour defended Cubism in his writings for the magazine, arguing that "a Cubist artist is neither a decadent nor degenerate but rather a militant and progressive artist." While asserting the progressive nature of the style, he crucially maintained that art's primary value lay in its aesthetic qualities, not its utility as propaganda. For Ziapour, the artist's role was pioneering within their medium. He saw Cubism as embodying "radical thinking"—decisive, rational, and forceful—and linked it to historical progress, suggesting it was the appropriate artistic expression for an era of social change and class struggle.

Ziapour was not alone. Other artists, including Hossein Kazemi, Hushang Pezeshkniya, and Manuchehr Sheybani, also explored Cubist ideas in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Kazemi developed a lyrical style blending Cubist geometry with elements of Iranian miniature painting. Pezeshkniya, returning from studies in Turkey, depicted the lives of ordinary people and oil workers, often employing fragmentation. Sheybani, a poet and playwright associated with the Tudeh party, similarly found inspiration in the working class for his Cubist works. Each artist developed distinct interpretations, often characterized by idiosyncratic uses of diagonal lines to structure their compositions.

### The Shift After the 1953 Coup

The political landscape, and consequently the cultural climate, underwent a dramatic transformation following the **CIA/MI6-orchestrated coup in 1953**. The **socially-engaged aspirations** aimed at shaping a modern public consciousness, characteristic of early Iranian modernism like Cubism, began to recede. Under Pahlavi patronage, a different artistic direction gained prominence, visible by the First Tehran Biennial in 1958. This new trend culminated in the **Saqqakhaneh school** of the 1960s. In contrast to the pre-coup emphasis on forging a new public through modern forms, Saqqakhaneh artists explored abstraction by drawing heavily on **local folk art, religious motifs, and vernacular objects**. This marked a shift towards a more particularizing, arguably inward-looking or narrowly nativist, perspective, moving away from the earlier ambition of forging a broad, modern public consciousness.

This profound shift can be symbolically represented by comparing Ziapour's defiant "Fighting Rooster" emblem with Parviz Tanavoli's iconic **"Heech" (Nothing)** sculptures, which emerged in the subsequent era. The trajectory from the assertive, sovereign artistic self symbolized by the rooster to the ambiguous, perhaps self-effacing, cipher of "Heech" reflects the changing socio-political conditions in post-coup Iran.

### The Legacy of Iranian Cubism

Despite the political shifts, Cubism did not disappear entirely from the Iranian art scene. It resurfaced periodically in the 1960s and 1970s, often relegated to the **periphery**. In some instances, it appeared as a nostalgic echo, visible in later works by artists like Hushang Pezeshkniya, who in this later period distanced himself from the Tehran art establishment and largely eschewed participation in the commercial art market. In other, more dramatic cases, Cubism was **re-politicized with leftist militancy**. A powerful example is found in the work of **Bizhan Jazani**, a prominent Marxist theorist and a founder of a leading guerrilla organization. Jazani was **imprisoned from 1968 until his extrajudicial execution by the state in 1975**. His painting commemorating the **Siahkal incident**—the February 1971 guerrilla attack on a gendarmerie post, widely seen as initiating the armed struggle phase against the Pahlavi regime—was **necessarily created during his incarceration**. This work visually and iconographically recalls Ziapour's "Fighting Rooster" from two decades prior, employing similar fragmented forms and symbolism (representing darkness and oppressive forces), potentially drawing parallels with Picasso's _Guernica_ as well. Jazani's prison painting demonstrates the potent and enduring resonance of Cubist aesthetics as a language for expressing political resistance, even under the extreme conditions of political imprisonment and facing state violence.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Iran's engagement with Cubism in the 1940s-50s represents a compelling chapter in the transnational circulation and adaptation of modernist ideas. Far from mere imitation, this exploration intertwined avant-garde aesthetics with urgent local desires for social change, artistic freedom, and national sovereignty. The 1953 coup proved a pivotal moment, redirecting Iranian modernism's path under the complex influences of consolidated state patronage, Cold War geopolitics, and nascent integration into the global art market—dynamics deserving fuller exploration. Ultimately, this era highlights the intricate dialogue between local artistic agency and powerful transnational forces in shaping a nation's cultural landscape during a period of profound transformation.
