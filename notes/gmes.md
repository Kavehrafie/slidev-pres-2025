subtitle: A Horizon of a Socialist Modernity

### Introduction

Good morning everyone. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the organizers of the Global Middle East Studies (GMES) symposium for their kind accommodation in arranging this Zoom presentation. While I am disappointed to miss being there in person, I am grateful for the chance to share my work with you today.

I want to talk about an overlooked chapter in Iranian history of modern art: the emergence and development of modernism in Iran, particularly an adoption of Cubism, between the 1940s and 1950s.To define this Cubism: "In those days and even later," as Iranian art historian Ruin Pakbaz notes, "any painting containing broken lines and angular shapes were considered cubism" [pakbaz]

I argue that the adoption of Cubism and other modernist styles (including Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Expressionism) in Iran during this period should not be dismissed merely as an imitation of European trends. Rather, it represents a historically specific development within the global history of modernism.
While deeply engaged with local themes, these artistic explorations were fueled by the avant-garde aspirations of Iranian artists seeking to overcome perceived cultural stagnation and actively shape the nation's cultural future, thereby contributing a distinct chapter to modern art's universal history. Furthermore, this social engagement was dialectically linked to the artists' pursuit of artistic autonomy amidst a larger national struggle for political and economic sovereignty—a struggle tragically cut short by the 1953 CIA/MI6-orchestrated coup.

### The Khorus Jangi Association

This early modernist impulse found concrete expression through self-organized groups of young artists in the late 1940s. A pivotal moment occurred in 1948 with the formation of the **Khorus Jangi (Fighting Rooster)** association. This avant-garde collective included artists and writers like Jalil Ziapour, Hasan Shirvani, Gholamhossein Gharib, Manuchehr Sheybani, and Morteza Hannaneh, occasionally joined by influential figures such as Nima Yushij, Sohrab Sepehri, and Bahman Mohasses. Their magazine, also named *Khorus Jangi*, served as a key platform, featuring Ziapour's iconic rooster design on its cover—effectively their first visual manifesto. Ziapour himself became a leading advocate for Cubism, promoting it through theoretical writings and public discourse.

Ziapour's striking rooster is characterized by a dynamic interplay of intersecting diagonal lines. These lines both fragment the picture plane to create visual energy and movement, and are skillfully integrated with the rooster's contours—wings spread wide, beak open in a defiant crow.

Notably, a frequent use of **dynamic diagonals** distinguished this work and others, suggesting links to Futurism and Constructivism and setting it apart from the analytical Cubism.

For the Khorus Jangi members, the rooster represented **wakefulness, renewal, resistance, and artistic independence**, embodying the call for Iranian culture to engage with modernity and the machine age. This symbolism resonated with contemporaries like the modernist poet Nima Yushij. His poem “From the City of Morning” (Az Shahr-e Ṣobḥ), written in response to the group's name, depicted the rooster's crow as a guiding force leading society out of darkness, mirroring the association's ambition to awaken public consciousness.

### Artistic and Political Opposition

It's particularly interesting that Ziapour, despite being inspired by modernity and machines, chose to explore Cubism through the lens of traditional Iranian public spaces like public bathhouses, bazaars, and mosques, unlike the modern urban subjects (cafe and bars) often found in European Cubist works.

This burgeoning modernist movement immediately encountered **fierce opposition**. Resistance came from the established art world, particularly followers of the academic painter Kamal ol-Molk, whose traditional European style dominated institutions like the School of Fine Arts (Ṣanāyiʿ-i Mustaẓrifa), founded in 1911. This artistic conservatism manifested directly when Ziapour's painting "Public Bath" was vandalized during its 1950 exhibition.

The opposition quickly escalated to the **political sphere**. In April 1949, Minister of Culture Manuchehr Eghbāl publicly denounced Khorus Jangi in parliament, labeling it a communist plot aimed at "corrupting the youth." This accusation resulted in the *Khorus Jangi* magazine being shut down and Ziapour facing interrogation, demanding justification for his promotion of Cubism. Ziapour was genuinely dumbfounded to discover that they were conflating Cubism and Communism.

In response, Ziapour defended Cubism in his writings for the magazine, arguing that "a Cubist artist is neither a decadent nor degenerate but rather a militant and progressive artist." While asserting the progressive nature of the style, he crucially maintained that art's primary value lay in its aesthetic qualities, not its utility as propaganda. For Ziapour, the artist's role was pioneering within the boundaries of the medium. He saw Cubism as embodying "radical (revolutionary) thinking (tafakor-e enghelabi)"—decisive, rational, and forceful—and linked it to historical progress, suggesting it was the appropriate artistic expression for an era of social change and class struggle.

Ziapour was not alone. Other artists, including Hushang Pezeshkniya, Hossein Kazemi and Manuchehr Sheybani, also explored Cubism in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Pezeshkniya, returning from studies in Turkey, depicted the lives of ordinary people and oil workers, often employing fragmentation. Kazemi developed a lyrical style blending Cubist geometry with elements of Iranian miniature painting. Sheybani, a poet and playwright affiliated with the Tudeh party, similarly found inspiration in the working class and peasant for his Cubist works. Each artist developed distinct interpretations, often characterized by idiosyncratic uses of diagonal lines to structure their compositions.

Perhaps an striking example of the association of Cubism with radical politics can be seen in the leaflet designed by Bahman Mohasses for International Workers' Day (May 1, 1953) in the period immediately preceding the August 1953 coup.

[In conclusion, Iran's engagement with Cubism in the 1940s-50s represents a compelling chapter in the transnational circulation and adaptation of modernist ideas and visual imagination. Far from mere imitation, this exploration intertwined avant-garde aesthetics with urgent local desires for social change, artistic freedom, and national sovereignty, using Cubist visual language to articulate a new vision of the society.]

### The Shift After the 1953 Coup

The political landscape, and consequently the cultural climate, underwent a dramatic transformation following the coup in 1953. The socially-engaged aspirations aimed at shaping a modern public consciousness, characteristic of early Iranian modernism like Cubism, began to recede. Under Pahlavi patronage, a different artistic direction gained prominence, visible by the First Tehran Biennial in 1958. This new trend culminated in the Saqqakhaneh school of the 1960s. In contrast to the pre-coup emphasis on forging a new public through modern forms, Saqqakhaneh artists explored abstraction by drawing heavily on calligraphy, religious motifs, and vernacular objects. This marked a shift towards a more particularizing, arguably inward-looking or narrowly nativist, perspective, moving away from the earlier ambition of forging a broad, modern public consciousness.

This profound shift can be symbolically represented by comparing Ziapour's defiant "Fighting Rooster" with Parviz Tanavoli's iconic **"Heech" (Nothing)** sculptures, which emerged in the subsequent era. The trajectory from the assertive, sovereign artistic self symbolized by the rooster to the ambiguous, perhaps self-effacing, cipher of "Heech" reflects the changing socio-political conditions in post-coup Iran.

### The Legacy of Iranian Cubism

Despite the political shifts, Cubism did not disappear entirely from the Iranian art scene. It resurfaced periodically in the 1960s and 1970s, often relegated to the **periphery**. In some instances, it appeared as a nostalgic echo, visible in later works by artists like Hushang Pezeshkniya, who in this later period distanced himself from the Tehran art establishment and largely eschewed participation in the art market. In other, more dramatic cases, Cubism was **re-politicized with leftist militancy**. A powerful example is found in the work of **Bizhan Jazani**, a prominent Marxist theorist and a founder of a leading guerrilla organization. Jazani was **imprisoned from 1968 until his extrajudicial execution by the state in 1975**. His painting commemorating the **Siahkal incident**—the February 1971 guerrilla attack on a gendarmerie post, widely seen as initiating the armed struggle phase against the Pahlavi regime—was **necessarily created during his incarceration**. This work visually and iconographically recalls Ziapour's "Fighting Rooster" from two decades prior, employing similar fragmented forms and symbolism (representing darkness and oppressive forces). Jazani's prison painting demonstrates the potent and enduring resonance of Cubist aesthetics as a language for expressing political resistance, even under the extreme conditions of political imprisonment and facing state violence.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Iran's engagement with Cubism in the 1940s-50s represents a compelling chapter in the transnational circulation and adaptation of modernist ideas and visual imagination. Far from mere imitation, this exploration intertwined avant-garde aesthetics with urgent local desires for social change, artistic freedom, and national sovereignty, using Cubist visual language to articulate a new vision of the society.

The 1953 coup proved a pivotal moment, redirecting Iranian modernism's path under the complex influences of consolidated state patronage, Cold War geopolitics, and nascent integration into the global art market—dynamics deserving fuller exploration. Ultimately, this era highlights the intricate dialogue between local artistic agency and powerful transnational forces in shaping a nation's cultural landscape during a period of profound transformation.
