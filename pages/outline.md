### Pakbaz on painting

In 1974, Iranian artist and art historian Ruyin Pākbāz (b. 1939) rejected Ziapour’s paintings as implementations of Cubism, arguing:

> Ironically, for it was his intention to achieve a synthesis between Cubism and traditional Iranian art, Ziapour’s “cubism” was not representative of what the term commonly denotes, for his art lacked some essential elements of Cubism. This was basically because Iranian mosques and bazaars, for example, just could not give way to industrial shapes and edifices, nor could traditional Iranian geometrical shapes, mostly curvilinear anyway, simply could not be replaced by the mechanistic geometrical forms favoured by Cubism.[pakbaz]

### ‌ Eghbāl

In April 1949, Manuchehr Eghbāl, the Minister of Culture under Prime Minister Abdolhossein Hazhir, denounced Khorus Jangi in a speech at the National Consultative Assembly (majles-e shora-ye melli):

> Tudeh initially targeted the working class and manipulated them. This time, they failed to fulfill the expectations of the working class. Since they were disappointed by the working class, they turned to intellectuals and began infiltrating the Ministry of Culture. They quickly infiltrated schools and colleges and corrupted the youth. They have published booklets titled “Khorus Jangi,” which you have seen, and they have them available to students in schools in 4th grade and above.[Etelaat #9615, 4 ordibehest 1328 ]

Eghbāl portrayed the magazine as part of a clandestine plot against the state, linking it to communist infiltration. This denunciation led to the forced closure of Khorus Jangi and the interrogation of Ziapour, who was an employee of the Ministry of Culture (vezārat-e farhang), which later merged under the Ministry of Education (āmuzesh va parvaresh), at the time. “Has anyone assigned you to promote Cubism? For what reasons have you chosen this field? What is essentially Cubism about?” Ziapour recalls being introgatted about his motivations for promoting Cubism.1

In his seminal 1948 essay “Painting” (Naqqāshi), published in five consequent parts in the first series of Khorus Jangi, Ziapour defended his position, stating that “a Cubist artist is neither a decadent nor degenerate but rather a militant and progressive artist.”1 This characterization of the Cubist artist as an “independent” and strident fighter aspiring to elevate culture reflected Ziapour’s conviction in the transformative power of art in society.2 Crucially, Ziapour argued that Cubist painting should express “radical thinking” (tafakkor-e enghelabi) that is “decisive and sharp, but at the same time rational, sober and forceful.”3 In a striking passage, Ziapour contextualized Cubism within the broader sweep of historical and social change:
… the era of Cubism was a time of struggle and consolidation of new ideas whose foundations were gradually laid long ago, and knowing this fact that along with every economic, political, and educational development, there always exists a new ideology, then one can better understand that the contexts of social change and class struggles at the time of the emergence of Cubism […] required a new ideology.4
Nevertheless, Ziapour insists that the judgment of art should rely on aesthetic merits rather than external political considerations:
From my point of view, the leading artist is someone who is a pioneer and a fighter only within their own art, not in the work of preaching and propaganda, “which is reserved for other non-artists.”5
