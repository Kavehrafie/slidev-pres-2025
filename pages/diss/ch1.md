# Introduction: The Rooster Crows

::statement::

## This chapter examines the historical conditions enabling modernist art in Iran, rejecting methodological nationalism’s reductive framing of cultural development. Instead, it positions Iranian modernism as neither belated nor derivative, but as an active negotiation of global capitalist modernity—one inseparable from Iran’s own uneven integration into transnational markets and cultural flows.

<!--
# Introduction

    -   Analyzing Iranian modernism not as "alternative" but within Jameson's "singular modernity" (global capitalism).
    -   Uneven development creates tensions: traditional practices vs. market forces.
    -   Critique of "methodological nationalism" and "belatedness" narratives.
    -   Focus on how artists negotiated position within global capitalism's reach.

# The Interregnum and the Early Pahlavi Patronage on Decline

<!--
"Beginning with the waning of early Pahlavi royal patronage, this chapter examines how modernist artists developed their practice in critical dialogue with Iran's declininh art establishment.
The Academic Establishment & Opposition:
- Left: Students at the School of Fine Arts (Ṣanāyiʿ-i Mustaẓrifa, est. 1911), founded by Kamal ol-Molk. This institution represented the established academic tradition.
- Right: Ismaʿil Ashtiyani's "View of Tehran" (1938), exemplifies the naturalist style favored by the academy.
- Point: The Khorus Jangi modernists faced significant institutional and artistic opposition from this established tradition, which dominated Iranian art institutions at the time.

This transition becomes visually evident when comparing early Ziapour's cubist experiments with another artist's naturalist treatment of the same subject.

Ziapour's "Sepahsalar Mosque" (1950):
- Another example of Ziapour depicting local Iranian architecture through a Cubist lens.
- Context: Illustrates the adaptation of the style. Critics like Pakbaz noted the difficulty of fitting Iranian architectural forms (mosques, bazaars) with their curvilinear elements into the "mechanistic forms" often favored by European Cubism. This led to stylistic divergences.

Modernist vs. Academic Depiction:
- Left: Ziapour's Cubist interpretation of Sepahsalar Mosque (1950).
- Right: Rassam Arjangi's traditional, naturalist painting of the same mosque. Arjangi was associated with the Kamal ol-Molk school.
- Point: This stark comparison highlights the stylistic clash between the emerging modernism and the established academic style.
- Opposition Example: Critics attacked Ziapour's work, with one claiming it wasn't a 'real' mosque due to the handling of the minarets, showing resistance to modernist interpretations.
