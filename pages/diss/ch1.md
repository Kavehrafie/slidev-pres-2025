## Lorem ipsum is a dummy or placeholder text commonly used in graphic design, publishing, and web development. Its purpose is to permit a page layout to be designed, independently of the copy that will subsequently populate it, or to demonstrate various fonts of a typeface without meaningful text that could be distracting. Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.

# The Interregnum and the Early Pahlavi Patronage on Decline

<!--
The Academic Establishment & Opposition:
- Left: Students at the School of Fine Arts (Ṣanāyiʿ-i Mustaẓrifa, est. 1911), founded by Kamal ol-Molk. This institution represented the established academic tradition.
- Right: Ismaʿil Ashtiyani's "View of Tehran" (1938), exemplifies the naturalist style favored by the academy.
- Point: The Khorus Jangi modernists faced significant institutional and artistic opposition from this established tradition, which dominated Iranian art institutions at the time.

Ziapour's "Sepahsalar Mosque" (1950):
- Another example of Ziapour depicting local Iranian architecture through a Cubist lens.
- Context: Illustrates the adaptation of the style. Critics like Pakbaz noted the difficulty of fitting Iranian architectural forms (mosques, bazaars) with their curvilinear elements into the "mechanistic forms" often favored by European Cubism. This led to stylistic divergences.

Modernist vs. Academic Depiction:
- Left: Ziapour's Cubist interpretation of Sepahsalar Mosque (1950).
- Right: Rassam Arjangi's traditional, naturalist painting of the same mosque. Arjangi was associated with the Kamal ol-Molk school.
- Point: This stark comparison highlights the stylistic clash between the emerging modernism and the established academic style.
- Opposition Example: Critics attacked Ziapour's work, with one claiming it wasn't a 'real' mosque due to the handling of the minarets, showing resistance to modernist interpretations.
