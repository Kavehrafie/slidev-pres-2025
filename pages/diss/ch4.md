# Monir Farmanfarmaian as Occult Technician

::statement::

## This chapter positions Farmanfarmaian’s mirror-work within a global fascination with the aesthetic of enchantment, demonstrating how her transatlantic practice—negotiating New York’s post-minimalism and Iran’s craft traditions—transformed nomadic artisanship into a strategic aesthetic paradigm operating through sacred geometries. Her abstractions materialized a transnational condition where artisanal ‘charm’ performed cultural fluidity while being inevitably enmeshed in neocolonial circuits of value.

<!-- While Farmanfarmaian's direct involvement with the Point Four Program was short-lived, that experience ignited a lifelong passion for documenting and preserving Iran's tribal cultures and indigenous crafts. As economic modernization increasingly threatened traditional ways of life, she felt compelled to take action. "Someone needed to save these pieces of our culture before they were lost," Farmanfarmaian emphatically stated in an interview.
The idea of adaptibility and fractal geometry as a means of exploring the infinite and a cultural expression of fending off the anxiety of modernity.
