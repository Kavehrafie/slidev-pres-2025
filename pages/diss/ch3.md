<!-- The incorporation of vernacular visual culture into Tanavoli's work was a significant development in the anthropologization of art in Iran.
Though neither a cohesive artistic school nor a unified movement, _Saqqākhāneh_ encompassed diverse artistic practices linked through their connection to Iranian religious visual culture, vernacular traditions, and folk art --- particularly devotional imagery and religious material culture.

<!--
The scholarship often focused on this Saqqākhāneh as the expression of "Iranian modernism". I think this erase the historical development and very nmuch put emphesis on Saqqakhaneh as the expression of national identity, which I think is a very narrow perspective and repeating the same narrative the Pahlavi regime was trying to promote.
