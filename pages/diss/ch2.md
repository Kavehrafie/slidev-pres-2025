# Jalil Ziapour: Constructing the Public

::statement::

## Lorem ipsum is a dummy or placeholder text commonly used in graphic design, publishing, and web development. Its purpose is to permit a page layout to be designed, independently of the copy that will subsequently populate it, or to demonstrate various fonts of a typeface without meaningful text that could be distracting. Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.
- Autonomy of art and the public
- the very question why Ziapour despite the strong opposition chose Cubism?

<!--
Ziapour's "Public Bath" (1949):
- Example of Ziapour applying Cubism to local Iranian subjects and everyday life.
- Significance: This painting was famously vandalized (slashed) during its first exhibition in 1950 by followers of the academic painter Kamal ol-Molk.
- Context: Demonstrates the fierce opposition the modernists faced from the established art world. Also touches on the challenge noted by critics like Pakbaz of adapting Cubist geometry to local, often curvilinear, forms.
