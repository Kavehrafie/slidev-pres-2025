Challenging recent scholarship that frames Global South modernism through International Surrealism's expansion, this study reveals how during Iran's brief political opening (1941-1953), modernists like Ziapour strategically employed Cubism - not merely as formal experimentation, but as part of a broader vision for socialist modernity. Their geometric fragmentation of reality constituted both an artistic rebellion against the academic establishment and a conceptual framework for reimagining social organization along progressive lines with reducing art to propaganda (contention b/w Z and Al-e Ahmad)

Ziapour's "Public Bath" (1949):
- Example of Ziapour applying Cubism to local Iranian subjects and everyday life.
- Significance: This painting was famously vandalized (slashed) during its first exhibition in 1950 by followers of the academic painter Kamal ol-Molk.
- Context: Demonstrates the fierce opposition the modernists faced from the established art world. Also touches on the challenge noted by critics like Pakbaz of adapting Cubist geometry to local, often curvilinear, forms.

<!-- These modernist experiments by 'pioneers'—pushing art's boundaries—were inextricably linked to collective organizing and public engagement. My dissertation specifically connects Ziapour's Public Bath to the Apadana Gallery, Iran's first independent artist-run space, revealing this crucial intersection. -->

The caption reads:{class="text-sm"}

<!--
This artistic self-assertion and reclamation of cultural production were fundamentally tied to broader social organizing efforts. The adoption of Cubism's visual logic thus represented more than aesthetic choice—it served as an organizational paradigm preceding the 1953 coup.
Bahman Mohasses - Cubism & Politics Pre-Coup:
- Artist: Bahman Mohasses, sometimes associated with the Khorus Jangi circle.
- Context: This is a leaflet for International Workers' Day (May 1, 1953) by the Third Force (Niruyi Sivvum) political party.
- Significance: The caption explicitly labels Mohasses's work as "Cubist style" and links it directly to the triumph of the working class. This demonstrates the clear association of Cubism with progressive politics in the period immediately preceding the August 1953 coup.
- The **Third Force (Niruyi Sivvum)** emerged from a significant split within the **Tudeh Party** of Iran in the late 1940s (around 1947-1948).

# The Emergence of Cold War Art Patronage in Post-Coup Iran

- Tehran Biennial (1958)
- The new Pahlavi Patronage
- US Cold War cultural diplomacy (the USIA and the Iran-America Society)

<!--
Following the 1953 coup, as the Shah's regime consolidated power amid U.S. backing and suppressed popular movements, it implemented modernization programs like the Kennedy-supported land reform. This political shift manifested culturally through new institutions - notably the General Administration of Fine Arts and the Tehran Biennial (1958, housed in the Ethnographic Museum) - which formed the bedrock of state cultural patronage while commissioning ethnographic studies of Iran's ethnic communities.

- Ziapour's serious engagement with ethnography began at the Office of Popular Culture (_farhang-i ‘āmmeh_).
Established in 1952 and active until 1973

Zeynab Khātūn_ (@fig:ziapourZeynabKhatun1953), unveiled at the 1958 Tehran Biennial, signaled a significant shift from modernist internationalism toward what he termed "national styled" (_sabk-i millī_).
Here he abondoed prior cubist experimentation and divided the picture plane based on tiles (trope l'oil Qajar haftran). He interpreted these images and cultural entrapment of subjects.
