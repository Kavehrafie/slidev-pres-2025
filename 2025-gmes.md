## "From the City of Morning" by Nīmā Yūshīj

*Cock-a-doodle-doo, crows the rooster,*  
*from the bottom of his solipsistic heart,*  
*from the depths of the way, like a dry vein,*  
*his voice pumps blood into lifeless corpse,*  
...  

*his voice delivers the message (of hope) to the free ear,*  
*shows the caravan its way to ābādān,*  
*through this kharāb-ābād.*  

*He strolls gently,*  
*He chants warmly,*  
*Beating his wings,*  
*Spreading his feathers.*  

*Longing for his voice, the caravan listens intently,*  
*is in high spirit because of its elegant voice,*  
*Cock-a-doodle-doo. On this dark path,*  
*Who is it who has fallen behind?*
*Who is it, who is tired?*  
...
